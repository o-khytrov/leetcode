/**
You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the
head of the modified linked list.

 The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ‚åän / 2‚åã·µó ∞ node from the
start using 0-based indexing, where ‚åäx‚åã denotes the largest integer less than or
equal to x.


 For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2,
respectively.



 Example 1:


Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are
written below.
Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
We return the new list after removing this node.


 Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.


 Example 3:


Input: head = [2,1]
Output: [2]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.


 Constraints:


 The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10‚Åµ].
 1 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ
