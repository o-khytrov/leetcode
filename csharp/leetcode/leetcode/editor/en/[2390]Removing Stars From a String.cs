/**
You are given a string s, which contains stars *.

 In one operation, you can:


 Choose a star in s.
 Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star
itself.


 Return the string after all stars have been removed.

 Note:


 The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
 It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.



 Example 1:


Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
- The closest character to the 1À¢·µó star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes "lee*
cod*e".
- The closest character to the 2‚Åø·µà star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes "lecod*
e".
- The closest character to the 3 ≥·µà star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes "lecoe".
There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".

 Example 2:


Input: s = "erase*****"
Output: ""
Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.



 Constraints:


 1 <= s.length <= 10‚Åµ
 s consists of lowercase English letters and stars *.
 The operation above can be performed on s.
