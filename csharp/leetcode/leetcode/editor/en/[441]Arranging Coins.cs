/**
You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The 
staircase consists of k rows where the iᵗʰ row has exactly i coins. The last row of 
the staircase may be incomplete. 

 Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you 
will build. 

 
 Example 1: 
 
 
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3ʳᵈ row is incomplete, we return 2.
 

 Example 2: 
 
 
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4ᵗʰ row is incomplete, we return 3.
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 1 <= n <= 2³¹ - 1
